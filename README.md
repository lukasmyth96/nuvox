# nuvox

### What is nuvox?
nuvox is an intelligent, on-screen keyboard that can be controlled with your eyes using commercial eye-tracking hardware.

### Who is it for?
nuvox is primarily designed for people with Motor Neuron Disease (MND) and other health conditions which prevent them from being able to speak or type. 

### Why are you building it?
Whilst there are some excellent eye-tracking keyboards already out there, the majority are outrageously expensive for what they are. 
[OptiKey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey) is a free, open-sourced alternative that I stumbled across a while ago and found really inspiring. My dad works at a school where several pupils communicate with these systems and after discussing it with him and trying them out for myself I identified several ways in which things could be improved. 

### How is nuvox different?

- nuvox uses a classic 9-key layout instead of the typical QWERTY keyboard. Bigger keys enable you to quickly dart your eyes from key to key with less mistakes. This allows for a faster, smoother and less frustrating user experience.

- nuvox leverages an insanely powerful machine learning algorithm called [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) to understand what you're trying to type. This means less time making corrections - more time saying what you want to say.

- nuvox embraces a minimalist design. Typing with your eyes can be tricky at the best of times - do you really need all those advanced buttons and settings taking up space? Keep it simple.
